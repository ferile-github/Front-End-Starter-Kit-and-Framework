# Front-End-Starter-Kit-and-Framework
What I use for just about every project I have been working on for the past five years

## Installation ##
Make sure you have node.js installed : https://nodejs.org/en/
First run 'gulp-install.bat' to install gulp and the dependancies. When thats all done, just run 'gulp-watch.bat' when you want to start working on the files.
