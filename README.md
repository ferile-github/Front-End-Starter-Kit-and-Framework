# Front End Starter Kit
What I use for just about every project I have been working on for the past five years.

## What is this?##
Knowledge that I have garnered over 10 years of Front End Web development. No, it doesn't have everything but it has enough to make a quick start on a project. What it does have though is :

- A gulp build to build the CSS, and Javascript
- A solid CSS framework, tried and testing over the years
- A Pattern Library to preview all your Typography, utility classes, CSS modules, the lot
- Jquery, Modernizr, PictureFill libraries, and a handy starter script.js
- A handy viewport/screensize plugin for when you need to know what scripts to run at a particular breakpoint


## Installation ##
Make sure you have node.js installed : https://nodejs.org/en/

First run 'gulp-install.bat' to install gulp and the dependancies. When thats all done, just run 'gulp-watch.bat' when you want to start working on the files.

## Credits and thanks ##
All the developers I have had the priviledge of working with over the years. I hope I have taught as much as I have learnt from all of you!
